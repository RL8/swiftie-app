## User Flow Implementation Details

### Public Access (No Account)

* Welcome Page - Replace the features button to log in for users who already have an account. That button should trigger a popup with only logging in option, no sign up.  
* The unregistered users who click get started can only access the onboarding pages below  
* Albums/Songs selection: as is  
* Share page: View all possible options. Call to action: Create free account to store and share your preferences, plus lots more TS fun and games  
* Register page with option to login:   
* If user successfully logs in, instead of creating a new account, then the temporary session with stored selections can be deleted as they should already have these choices from when they created their account  
* If unregistered user tries to access a URL that requires logging in, take them to a page that lets them know the page they tried to access and tells them to create account or sign in to access it  
* Of course, if any user goes to a page that doesn't exist, they can go to the standard 4o4 page

### Free Account (After Signing up)

* Verification screen until email is verified as we discussed  
* Profile Page: Personal profile with username and basic info. User is encouraged to update their username   
* Feed Page: Summarises all the user's actions in the app in feed-style chronological order e.g. they selected their 3 albums with 3 respective songs, they verified their email, they logged in.  
* Swiftivities:   
  * This is a list of potential activities the user can do in the app.   
  * For example, the onboarding exercise of selecting top 3 songs on top 3 albums is part of the List Keeper swiftivity.   
  * Therefore, the user has already engaged in this activity, and they can access this 3x3 list within the list keeper activity. 		  
  * From here, they can edit their selections by going through the album/song selection again with their original choices still visible. 	  
  * Other potential lists in addition to the 3x3 discussed above are also available under List Keeper, such as 11x3 and 5x10 which are premium only.   
  * Within each swiftivity, there will be free and premium options for the user to select from.  
  * Clicking on the 3x3 option takes you to a view of what is currently the "share page" with relevant options now that the user is logged in  
* Sharing swiftivity content: each swiftivity has the ability to be shared to social media, including ability to add custom text to accompany the image
