# Sprint 3 - Part 1: Navigation Simplification

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the first part of Sprint 3, focusing on simplifying the navigation structure of the Swiftie App. The goal is to create a more consistent user experience between different sections of the app by updating the navigation components and ensuring consistent dimensions and styling.

## Implementation Timeline
**Start Time:** March 27, 2025
**Estimated Completion:** March 30, 2025

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Navigation Component Updates
**Objective:** Create a new bottom navigation component that provides consistency across the app.

#### Components to Modify:

1. **`src/lib/components/navigation/AppNavigation.svelte`**
   - Create a new navigation component to replace BottomNav
   - Make it adaptable to the footer component on Section 2 pages
   - Ensure it maintains the same dimensions and styling as the Footer component
   - Include navigation items: Feed, Swiftivities, Profile, and Settings

2. **`src/lib/components/layout/MainAppLayout.svelte`**
   - Update to use the new AppNavigation component
   - Ensure consistent header and footer dimensions matching Section 1
   - Verify navigation items are correctly linked

3. **`src/lib/components/BottomNav.svelte`**
   - Deprecate this component after AppNavigation is implemented

#### Progress Indicators:
- [ ] New AppNavigation component created
- [ ] MainAppLayout updated to use AppNavigation
- [ ] BottomNav component deprecated
- [ ] Navigation consistency verified across app sections

### Phase 2: Settings Page Implementation
**Objective:** Complete the Settings page implementation to replace About Us functionality.

#### Components to Modify:

1. **`src/routes/settings/+page.svelte`**
   - Ensure proper integration with the rest of the app
   - Verify all sections are working correctly:
     - About Us
     - App Preferences
     - Premium Features
     - Help & Support
   - Use the updated navigation components

2. **`src/routes/settings/+page.server.ts`**
   - Update server-side logic to support settings functionality
   - Ensure data is properly loaded without authentication

#### Progress Indicators:
- [ ] Settings page fully functional
- [ ] All sections properly implemented
- [ ] Server-side logic updated
- [ ] Navigation to/from Settings page working correctly

### Phase 3: Swiftivities Page Update
**Objective:** Update the Swiftivities page to reflect the new structure without authentication.

#### Components to Modify:

1. **`src/routes/swiftivities/+page.svelte`**
   - Update to reflect the new structure without authentication
   - Ensure it uses the updated navigation components
   - Verify all swiftivity options are accessible

2. **`src/routes/swiftivities/+page.server.ts`**
   - Update server-side logic to support swiftivities without authentication
   - Ensure data is properly loaded from localStorage where needed

#### Progress Indicators:
- [ ] Swiftivities page updated
- [ ] Navigation components integrated
- [ ] Server-side logic updated
- [ ] All swiftivity options accessible

### Phase 4: Profile Page Update
**Objective:** Update the Profile page to allow users to manage their information without authentication.

#### Components to Modify:

1. **`src/routes/profile/+page.svelte`**
   - Update to allow users to change their username without authentication
   - Implement functionality for users to add or edit their basic info
   - Ensure profile data is stored in localStorage
   - Use the updated navigation components

2. **`src/routes/profile/+page.server.ts`**
   - Update server-side logic to support profile management without authentication
   - Ensure data is properly loaded from localStorage where needed

#### Progress Indicators:
- [ ] Profile page updated
- [ ] Username change functionality implemented
- [ ] Basic info editing implemented
- [ ] localStorage integration completed
- [ ] Navigation components integrated

### Phase 5: Local Storage Implementation
**Objective:** Ensure all user selections and preferences are properly stored in localStorage.

#### Components to Modify:

1. **`src/lib/utils/storage-helpers.ts`**
   - Create or update helper functions for localStorage management
   - Implement functions for storing and retrieving user selections
   - Ensure data persists between sessions

2. **Various Components**
   - Update components that need to store user data to use the storage helpers
   - Ensure album selections, song choices, and user preferences are stored

#### Progress Indicators:
- [ ] Storage helper functions created/updated
- [ ] User selections stored in localStorage
- [ ] User preferences stored in localStorage
- [ ] Data persistence verified between sessions

### Phase 6: Consistency Verification
**Objective:** Ensure consistent dimensions and styling across all pages.

#### Components to Verify:

1. **All Layout Components**
   - Verify header height: --header-height: clamp(74px, 12vh, 96px)
   - Verify footer height: --footer-height: clamp(74px, 12vh, 96px)
   - Ensure consistent styling using the theme variables

2. **All Page Components**
   - Verify that all pages use the updated layout components
   - Ensure consistent styling across the app

#### Progress Indicators:
- [ ] Header dimensions verified
- [ ] Footer dimensions verified
- [ ] Theme variables consistently applied
- [ ] Layout components used consistently

## Success Metrics
- Improved navigation consistency between app sections
- Simplified codebase through removal of authentication-related components
- Enhanced user experience with consistent dimensions and styling
- Successful local storage implementation for user data persistence

## Dependencies
- Svelte 5 runes mode compatibility
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- localStorage API for data persistence
