# Swiftie App Component Library

Welcome to the Swiftie App component library. This Storybook contains all the components used in the application, organized by category.

## Component Categories

- **Components**: Basic UI components like buttons, inputs, and cards
- **Visualizations**: Data visualization components like charts and graphs

## Theme and Styling

The components in this library use the app's theme variables defined in:
- `src/lib/styles/theme.css`: Core theme variables
- `src/lib/styles/forms.css`: Form-specific styling
- `src/app.css`: Global application styles

## Usage Guidelines

When creating new components:
1. Follow the existing styling patterns
2. Use theme variables instead of hardcoded values
3. Ensure components are responsive
4. Test components in different states and configurations

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new component in the appropriate directory
2. Add the component to Storybook with relevant stories
3. Test the component in isolation
4. Integrate the component into the application
